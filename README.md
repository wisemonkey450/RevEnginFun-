I love reversing and this just a scratchpad to share with you all.



# obfuscation_xoy.py

Usage:
./obfuscation_xoy.py <filename1.h> <filename2.h> ...

This tool will produce C source and headers file pairs for each file that you supply in the argument list. The purpose of the tool is to generate functions that will be able to obfuscate strings through XOR. The general format is below:

//C src
/* AUTOGENERATED FILE --- IT IS UNWISE TO MODIFY*/
#include "test.h"

int cat_(random4bytes)_1[15] = {0x54,0x56,0x65,0x31,0xe5,0x9a,0x2,0x57,0xa6,0x3f,0xd3,0x7a,0x70,0xb,0xbb};
int cat_(random4bytes)_2[15] = {0x37,0x37,0x11,0x11,0xca,0xff,0x76,0x34,0x89,0x4f,0xb2,0x9,0x3,0x7c,0xdf};


//This function will return cat_7kgtf when xored
char *decode_print_cat_7kgtf(){
	char *decoded = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * 15);
	for(int i = 0; i < 15; i++){
		decoded[i] = cat_7kgtf_1[i] ^ cat_7kgtf_2[i];
	}
	return decoded;
}

Where the length of the string will change, so 15 is not a constant.

//C hdr
#ifndef _test
#define _test


/* AUTOGENERATED FILE --- IT IS UNWISE TO MODIFY*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <unistd.h>


//Function that will decode the above strings
char * decode_print_cat_7kgtf();

#endif /* _test.h */

Header guards and some includes that are common, but not neccessary. Feel free to remove them if need be.

To use the functions (the whole point right?)...do something like this:
char * super_duper_secret = decode_print_cat_7kgtf();

Note, the function do not take any arguments...the args are global variables...for now.

You must then compile them. It might look like:
gcc main.c <filename1.c> <filename2.c> ... -o no_re
